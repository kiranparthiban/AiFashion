# AiFashion ‚Äì AI-Powered Fashion Design & Recommendation Platform

AiFashion is a full-stack web application that leverages state-of-the-art generative AI to help designers and consumers ideate, generate, and discover fashion styles in seconds.  The platform couples a **Django REST** API with a blazing-fast **React (Vite)** front-end to deliver a seamless user experience, while keeping the code-base clean, modular, and production-ready.
